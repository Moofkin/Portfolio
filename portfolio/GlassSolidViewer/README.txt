README- Glass Solid Viewer

This application was created by Andrew Parvis and Lauren Cunningham, and is intended to accurately depict a glass material. It uses a conjunction of JavaScript and WebGL to accomplish this.

The three.js library, authored by Ricardo Cabello, was used in the making of this application. More documentation on this library can be found online at: http://threejs.org/.

The Glass Solid Viewer was created on a Windows 64-bit platform, and compatibility with other platforms cannot be guaranteed.

How to run: Open the file “index.html” located within the code folder in Mozilla Firefox.
	NOTE: This application is not compatible with other browsers!
